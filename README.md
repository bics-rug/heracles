# Heracles

Heracles is physics-based compactor model for HfO2-based ferroelectric capacitors. It includes thermal models, interface layers and accurately reproduces several device phenomena, such as transient polarization switching and capacitance hysteresis. Heracles consists of a stateful and computationally efficient non-equilibrium thermodynamics description of the device behaviour, allowing for efficient Monte Carlo simulations even in larger analog CMOS circuits. This makes Heracles suitable for Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) approaches to (analog) compute-in-memory, neuromorphic systems or sensory circuit design.

## Examples

A Verilog-A implementation that is tested in Cadence Spectre is available, including Monte-Carlo parameters. The paramters were extracted from measurement data by the Department of Electrical Engineering of IIT Bombay, as seen in the article cited below.
