It includes thermal models, interface layers and accurately reproduces several device phenomena, such as transient polarization switching and capacitance hysteresis. Heracles consists of a stateful and computationally efficient non-equilibrium thermodynamics description of the device behaviour, allowing for efficient Monte Carlo simulations even in larger analog CMOS circuits. This makes Heracles suitable for Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) approaches to (analog) compute-in-memory, neuromorphic systems or sensory circuit design.</p>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>docs/\n    index.md            # The documentation homepage\nngpsice/\n    modelcard.l         # Ngspice modelcard\n    testbench.sp        # Ngspice P-V hysteresis testbench\nvirtuoso/\n    cdf.il              # Virtuoso cdf file\n    fehlings2025.scs    # Spectre modelcard\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\nheracles.va             # Heracles VerilogA source code\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>A Verilog-A implementation that is tested in Cadence Spectre is available, including Monte-Carlo parameters.

Create a symbol with 2 inout pins named te and be. Then, in the Virtuoso main window, open Tools/CDF/Edit and load cdf.il. Now import the model card in your Maestro test bench via Setup/Model Libraries, for example fehlings2024.scs for the model card of the source citation. In Setup/environment (or in the hierachy editor when used) make sure that the spectre view is included in switch and stop lists.</p> <p>Alternatively create a veriloga view and paste in the source code, then import the model card in Maestro. Keep in mind that in this way mismatch Monte Carlo simulations may not work, depending on your Virtuoso configuration and CMOS PDK.</p>"},{"location":"#ngspice","title":"Ngspice","text":"<p>For a demo in ngspice, compile the source code using the OpenVAF Verilog-A compiler or download the osdi binary with the release.
