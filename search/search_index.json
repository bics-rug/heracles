It includes thermal models, interface layers and accurately reproduces several device phenomena, such as transient polarization switching and capacitance hysteresis. Heracles consists of a stateful and computationally efficient non-equilibrium thermodynamics description of the device behaviour, allowing for efficient Monte Carlo simulations even in larger analog CMOS circuits. This makes Heracles suitable for Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) approaches to (analog) compute-in-memory, neuromorphic systems or sensory circuit design.</p>"},{"location":"#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>docs/                   # Documentation source\nvirtuoso/\n    cdf.il              # Virtuoso cdf file\n    fehlings2025.scs    # Spectre modelcard\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\nheracles.va             # Heracles VerilogA source code\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>A Verilog-A implementation that is tested in Cadence Spectre is available, including Monte-Carlo parameters.
