# Getting started

This is a short getting started to start using Heracles within a circuit simulation.
For accessibility, we are going to use ngspice as circuit simulator. Ngspice is a open source circuit simulator with a permissive license and thus makes it easy to share test benches for circuit designs and compact model characterization.
Note that you can of course also replicate these test benches within e.g. Cadence Spectre, more on that in the [Spectre section](spectre.md)

## Setup

### Install ngspice

#### Linux

ngspice is packaged for many major Linux distributions, such as Arch, Debian, Fedora, SUSE and Ubuntu.
Use your package manager to install the package from the respective repository.

#### Mac

`brew install ngspice`

#### Windows

[Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/files/ng-spice-rework/44.2/ngspice-44.2_64.7z/download)

#### Docker

See the dockerfile at [bics-rug/heracles-testbenches](https://github.com/bics-rug/heracles-testbenches).

## Testbenches

Open source testbenches based on ngspice are available in [bics-rug/heracles-testbenches](https://github.com/bics-rug/heracles-testbenches). These are in early development and documentation will follow.
